Foundational benchmark:  is   generated  using Unified foundational ontology (UFO). 

We claim that a top-level ontology gives a common and recurring shape to both data and queries – our benchmark shows  how  an  index  based  on  OWL  representation  of  UFO implemented  invarious  triple  stores  can  help  making  SPARQL  evaluation  more  efficient  oversuch data.

The benchmark is used to compare difreent triple stores using generated and existing real datasets
 the generated dataset is generated by UFO-based Data Generator: which  is a  RDF triples generator. 

It generates data based on a foundational ontology model, the main entities in this models are (Oject, Event, Tropes, Actions).

The generated data is stored in a triple stores and is indexed using UFO index [1].
